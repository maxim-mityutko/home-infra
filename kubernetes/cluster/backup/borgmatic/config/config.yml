# NOTES:

# Original connection provided by the Borgwarehouse, however replaced it with
# local path mounted to NFS share to speed up the process and avoid bandwidth constraints
# of the SSH protocol.

# `Borgwarehouse` runs under UID 1001, however `borgmatic` uses UID 1000 (root) and changing it to anything
# else breaks the container, hence the temporary workaround is to CHMOD more permissions on the repo directory.
