# Mounting external locations for the photos handled by Immich.
# 1.  The `/media/photos/immich` points to the Immich data path with library, previews, etc.
#     Because this path should only be handled by Immich, it is mounted as read-only.
# 2.  The `/media/photos/external` points to what Immich calls external libraries. This path
#     is periodically scanned by Immich and can contain files that are manually added by the
#     user. This will be exposed in Nextcloud.
# TODO: figure out execution context and permissions. NextCloud is running under `www-data` (33) user by default.
